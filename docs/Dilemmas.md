# Dilemmas
## Navigating the Path to Unraid
In the ever-evolving landscape of home lab setups, the journey to finding the ideal platform often involves navigating through a series of dilemmas. Each choice carries its own set of considerations, challenges, and learnings. Here's a glimpse into my decision-making process and the evolution of my homelab journey:

### Initial Exploration
- **Platform Hopping**: The quest for a suitable home lab platform commenced with the exploration of various options. The primary criterion was a free platform, as the overarching goal was not just to implement a solution but to delve deep into the intricacies of system administration and virtualization.

- **Proxmox Debut**: The initial choice was Proxmox, a robust and feature-rich open-source virtualization platform. While Proxmox offered a compelling set of features, the learning curve felt steep in the early stages, prompting a reconsideration of alternatives.

### Transition to TrueNAS Scale

- **Seeking Guidance**: Acknowledging the need for more structured guidance, the focus shifted to TrueNAS Scale—a promising and scalable open-source storage solution. The intention was to align the learning curve with a more supportive environment.

- **Unforeseen Challenges**: Unfortunately, the timing coincided with a period of substantial changes within the TrueNAS Scale ecosystem. The OS underwent significant transformations, leading to a series of challenges and disruptions in the form of persistent issues that demanded frequent container redeployments.

### Embrace of Unraid

- **Why Unraid?**: The journey eventually led to Unraid—a choice grounded in the quest for stability, user-friendliness, and a supportive community. Unraid's unique approach to storage management, coupled with a robust plugin system and an intuitive interface, addressed the key requirements for a fulfilling home lab experience.

- **Learning with Stability**: Unraid's stability became a crucial factor, allowing me to focus on learning and experimentation rather than troubleshooting persistent issues. The platform's balance between simplicity and functionality aligned seamlessly with the educational goals of the home lab.

### In Retrospect

While each platform had its merits, the decision to settle with Unraid was motivated by a harmonious blend of stability, user-friendliness, and a community-driven ethos. The dilemmas faced along the way contributed not only to a refined understanding of platform preferences but also to a more profound appreciation for the dynamic nature of the home lab environment.

In the intricate dance of dilemmas and decisions, Unraid emerged as a reliable partner, fostering an environment where learning and exploration could thrive without the hindrance of persistent challenges. The journey continues, enriched by the experiences of platform exploration and the steadfast commitment to the ever-evolving landscape of home labs.
