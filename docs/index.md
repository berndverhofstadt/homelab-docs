## What is VCloud?

VCloud, your very own Virtual Cloud, is a haven for those who seek to replicate the power and flexibility of a cloud environment. This homelab is engineered to operate on your premises while maintaining the potential to seamlessly transition into a public cloud environment. VCloud thrives on versatility, adaptability, and, most importantly, your curiosity.

### Key Features
- **Privacy Focus**: Your privacy matters. VCloud places a strong emphasis on keeping your data and activities private, ensuring that your homelab experience remains secure and discreet.
- **Unraid OS at the Core**: The heart of VCloud beats with the robust Unraid operating system, providing stability, flexibility, and efficient resource management. It's the bedrock of your homelab exploration.
- **Dockerized Awesomeness**: Embrace the power of Docker containers within VCloud. These lightweight, portable containers encapsulate services and applications, promoting seamless operation and simplified management.

## Getting Started
Your journey into the VCloud universe begins with our comprehensive documentation. Navigate through step-by-step guides that cover everything from initial setup to advanced configurations. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced user, VCloud's documentation is designed to be your trusted companion.

## How to use these docs

If you want to follow roughly the same path as this homelab, a sensible reading order is:

1. [Unraid OS](Hardware-&-OS/Unraid-OS.md) – get familiar with the base operating system and its plugin ecosystem.
2. [Unraid backup and restore strategy](Hardware-&-OS/Unraid-Backup-and-Restore.md) – understand how the configuration is protected.
3. [Networking](Networking/index.md) – custom Docker network, reverse proxy (Traefik), DNS and tunnels.
4. [Authentication](Authentication/index.md) – Authelia as access gateway and authentik as Identity Provider.
5. [Home Automation](Home-Automation/index.md) – OpenHab and the Smart Grid integration for the heat pump boiler.
6. [Productivity tools](Productivity%20Tools/index.md) – self‑hosted apps for files, diagrams, utilities and more.

You can, of course, jump directly to any topic that matches your current project, but this order mirrors how the environment grew over time.
